* 📚 **Check out repositories**: view the latest 5 repos with info and links
* 🌙 **Switch themes**: light and dark mode with system preference support

Would you like me to make it **more casual and beginner-friendly** (like talking directly to someone new to GitHub), or keep it **professional and concise** (for portfolio/work showcase)?
